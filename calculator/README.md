# met-cs-601-week-3-calculator

This repository contains the source code for the Week 3 Assignment which is to create a simple calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to add two numbers provided by the user. These numbers provided by the user in a user prompt (Example: 1, 3), and then the addition result is provided via a JavaScript alert. After the initial addition, the application will ask the user if they want to keep adding numbers which will repeat the prompts and alerts until the user decides they are finished. 

Additionally, buttons are present to change the current user and to manually initiate the prompts and alerts to add numbers.
