                <p>I graduated Trumbull High School (Connecticut) in 2010. In 2014, I graduated from The George Washington
                    University with a Bachelors of Science in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Chemistry. I am
                    expected to graduate from Boston University with a Masters of Science in Software Development in Spring
                    of 2023. I am really enjoying this program and I think it is a good challenge for me personally and
                    professionally. With this degree I hope to reinforce my professional credentials, improve my
                    self-confidence, and (hopefully) get a big raise/promotion at my job! Below is a table of the courses
                    that I have successfully completed with their grades.</p>
